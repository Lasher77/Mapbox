## Environment Variables

The backend connects to Salesforce and expects the credentials to be
available through environment variables:

- `SALESFORCE_USERNAME`
- `SALESFORCE_PASSWORD`
- `SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN`

You can create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and load it before
running the API.
